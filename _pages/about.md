I'm a phd student from [School of Statistics](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn)ï¼Œ [Renmin University](https://www.ruc.edu.cn). My research interest includes high dimensional statistics, empirical process, low-rank matrix estimation, semiparametric method and nonignorable missing mechanism.

I am very fortunate to be adivesd by [Prof. Bo Zhang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/jxtd/jsdw/sltjx/ad4fa17aba5345a99f2b53a954652cd3.htm), Renmin University of China
